# Minimal-IK

A simple and naive inverse kinematics solver for MANO hand model, SMPL body model, and SMPLH body+hand model.

Briefly, given joint coordinates (and optional other keypoints), the solver gives the corresponding model parameters.

Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm is used, the energy is simply the L2 distance between the keypoints.

## Usage

### Models

1. Download the official model from MPI.
2. See `config.py` and set the official model path.
3. See `prepare_model.py`, use the provided function to pre-process the model.

### Solver

1. See `example.py`, un-comment the corresponding code.
2. `python example.py`.
3. The example ground truth mesh and estimated mesh are saved to `gt.obj` and `est.obj` respectively.

### Dependencies

Every required package is available via `pip install`.
